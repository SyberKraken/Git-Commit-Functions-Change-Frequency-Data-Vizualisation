This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This repo vizualises the amount of changes to its own or other git repos javascript/typescript functions 
with a treemap via nextjs

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see a treemap generated from
the repo linked in the "remote_branch_fetch" api page

## TODO

make the tree generate from input on webpage or from api call

remove old python code

make treemap of %bugfixes from some form of input of what is considered bugfix commits, Maybe list of commits, maybe some specific phrase in the names of the commits.
